# Lung Cancer Analysis (SQL Project)

# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing lung cancer data using MySQL to extract insights related to smoking habits, air pollution exposure, cancer prevalence, and mortality rates. The study aims to highlight key risk factors and trends using SQL queries.

# Dataset:

The dataset includes multiple health-related attributes such as:

Smoking status (Smokers/Non-Smokers)

Air pollution exposure levels

Cancer stages

Number of cigarettes smoked per day

Lung cancer prevalence and mortality rates by country

Patient demographics (Age, Gender)

# Key Insights

Smoking and Lung Cancer: Among the analyzed data, 23.97% of smokers developed lung cancer.

Cigarette Consumption: Smokers consumed an average of 17 cigarettes per day.

Air Pollution Impact: 55,108 individuals were exposed to high air pollution levels.

Global Mortality Rates: China had the highest lung cancer deaths, totaling 690,000 cases.

Lung Cancer by Gender: 3,629 females and 5,332 males were diagnosed with lung cancer.

Highest Prevalence: Egypt recorded the highest lung cancer prevalence rate at 2.5%.

Cancer Stage Analysis: The average smoking years for Stage 4 cancer patients is 14.56 years.

Age Factor: The average age of lung cancer patients ranges between 51 to 54 years across all countries.

Mortality Rate Ranking: Brazil ranks first with an average mortality rate of 76.23%.

# Tools & Technologies Used

SQL (MySQL): Data extraction, transformation, and query execution

Command Prompt: Used for data import operations

# Conclusion

This SQL-based analysis provides data-driven insights into lung cancer prevalence, highlighting risk factors such as smoking and air pollution. The findings can help healthcare professionals and policymakers take preventive actions based on statistical evidence.
